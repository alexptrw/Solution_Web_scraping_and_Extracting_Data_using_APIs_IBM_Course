This project is part of the **Python Project for Data Engineering - Hands-on Lab: Web Scraping and Extracting Data using APIs** by IBM in Coursera. 

### Project Overview:

In this additional task, we are modifying the code to extract specific information from a web page that lists Rotten Tomatoes' Top 100 films. The modifications focus on:

1. Extracting Film, Year, and Rotten Tomatoes' Top 100 Headers.
2. Restricting the results to the top 25 films.
3. Filtering the output to only display films released in the 2000s (from year 2000 onward).

Once the data is extracted and processed, it is saved into both a CSV file and an SQLite database for further use.

### Task Description:

- Scrape the data of the top 100 films from Rotten Tomatoes, including the film's title, year of release, and ranking position.
- Restrict the output to only the top 25 films.
- Filter the results to include only films released in the 2000s or later (from 2000 onward).
- The resulting filtered data will be saved into a CSV file 
- The same filtered data will also be stored in an SQLite database
